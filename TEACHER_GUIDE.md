# Inequality Quest: Mission Algebra - Teacher's Guide

## Overview
**Inequality Quest** is an interactive, gamified learning experience designed to help 7th graders master solving inequalities while having fun! The game aligns with Florida Standards MA.8.AR.2.2 and MA.K12.MTR.7.1.

## Learning Objectives Covered
✅ **MA.8.AR.2.2**: Solve two-step linear inequalities in one variable and represent solutions algebraically and graphically
- Forms: px ± q > r
- Forms: p(x ± q) > r
- Variables on both sides
- Algebraic and graphical representations

✅ **MA.K12.MTR.7.1**: Apply mathematics to real-world contexts
- 16+ real-world scenarios included
- Gaming, sports, shopping, science, and more

## Game Features

### 🎮 Three Difficulty Levels
1. **Training Academy (Easy)**: Basic inequalities (px ± q > r)
2. **Field Operations (Medium)**: Distribution form p(x ± q) > r
3. **Expert Challenges (Hard)**: Variables on both sides

### 🌟 Engagement Features
- **Real-world scenarios**: Every problem relates to students' lives
- **Visual number lines**: Shows solutions graphically
- **Step-by-step solutions**: Explains the solving process
- **Hint system**: Provides scaffolding when needed
- **Achievements & badges**: Rewards streaks and mastery
- **Progress tracking**: Shows completion and accuracy
- **Confetti animations**: Celebrates success

## How to Use in Your Classroom

### Option 1: Individual Practice (15-20 minutes)
Students can play independently for:
- Warm-up activity
- Centers/stations rotation
- Early finisher enrichment
- Homework/home practice
- Review before assessments

### Option 2: Partner Challenge (20-30 minutes)
Students work in pairs:
- One solves, one checks work
- Compare strategies
- Discuss different approaches
- Compete for highest score

### Option 3: Whole Class Competition (30-40 minutes)
Use for:
- Team tournaments
- Class leaderboards
- Mixed-ability grouping
- Formative assessment

### Option 4: Differentiated Learning
- **Struggling students**: Start with Training Academy
- **On-level students**: Use mixed mode
- **Advanced students**: Focus on Expert Challenges

## Assessment Opportunities

### Formative Assessment
Monitor student progress by:
- Observing which difficulty levels students choose
- Checking hint usage (high usage = needs support)
- Reviewing accuracy percentages
- Noting common mistakes in specific problem types

### Data to Collect
The game tracks:
- Score (indicates overall performance)
- Accuracy rate (number correct / total)
- Streak count (consecutive correct answers)
- Hints used (indicates independence level)
- Badges earned (engagement metric)

### Discussion Questions After Gameplay
1. "What strategy did you use to solve inequalities with variables on both sides?"
2. "How is solving an inequality different from solving an equation?"
3. "Which real-world scenario was most interesting? Why?"
4. "What does the number line representation tell us about the solution?"
5. "When would you use an open circle vs. a closed circle?"

## Extension Activities

### 1. Create Your Own Problems
Have students:
- Write their own real-world scenarios
- Design problems for classmates
- Share creative contexts

### 2. Deeper Exploration
- Why do we flip the inequality when multiplying/dividing by negatives?
- How would the problem change if the inequality symbol reversed?
- Create compound inequalities from game scenarios

### 3. Cross-Curricular Connections
- **Science**: Temperature ranges, experiment conditions
- **PE/Sports**: Scoring requirements, time limits
- **Financial Literacy**: Budgeting scenarios
- **Environmental**: Conservation goals

## Technical Requirements

### Browser Compatibility

## Common Student Misconceptions & Game Support

### Misconception 1: "Just solve like an equation"
**Game addresses**: Step-by-step solutions show inequality-specific steps

### Misconception 2: "The direction of inequality doesn't matter"
**Game addresses**: Number line visualization shows why direction matters

### Misconception 3: "Open and closed circles are the same"
**Game addresses**: Visual number line clearly differentiates

### Misconception 4: "Math isn't relevant to real life"
**Game addresses**: 16+ real-world scenarios show practical applications

## Troubleshooting

### Students finish too quickly
- Have them try harder difficulty levels
- Challenge them to get 100% accuracy
- Ask them to explain solutions to peers
- Create their own problems

### Students are struggling
- Encourage use of hint system
- Start with easier difficulty
- Pair with stronger students
- Review step-by-step solutions together

### Technical issues
- Refresh the browser
- Try a different browser
- Clear browser cache
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
